To assist getting started there is a folder under examples called OilerBuilder
In here is a windows executable - OilerBuilder.exe. This allows a user to fill in details
about the number (max 6) and types of motors they are using in their implementation. Pins and 
features can be enabled. At the end it will auto generate an arduino sketch that can be used as the
start point for an implementation.

To use the Oilerbuilder download the release and install it. Then run the Oilerbuilder.exe from the directory in which
it is located.
