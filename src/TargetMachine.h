//
// This class represents the machine that is being oiled
//
// It has two attributes: 
//		A signal that indicates the machine is active
//		A signal that indicates the machine has completed a unit of work
//
//	In our example machine - a metal working lathe, the active signal indicaates the machine is moving and the unit of work is a completed full rototation of the lather spindle
//
// The class keeps track of active time and number of units of work completed. These are optional inputs for the Oiler class to refine when it delivers oil.
