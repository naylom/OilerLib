	OilerLib Example sketch - Alert

	Author:	Mark Naylor, June 2021

	Description

	This sample sketch demonstrates using the OilerLib library to:
		control two pumps using relay driven motors
		respond to motor related input sensors that indicates the pump has output oil and pause the related motor when configured amount of oil is delivered
		restart motors after a specified elapsed time
		raise an alert signal if a pump is delayed in delivering oil
