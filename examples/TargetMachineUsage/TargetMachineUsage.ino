	OilerLib Example sketch - TargetMachineUsage

	Author:	Mark Naylor, June 2021

	Description

	This sample sketch demonstrates how to use signals from the machine being oiled to get enhanced features from the OilerLib library:
		This sets up one relay driven pump
		respond to a related input sensor that indicates the pump has output oil and pause the related motor when configured amount of oil is delivered
		restart pump after a target machine indicates work has been done or after target machine has had power for a set number of seconds
